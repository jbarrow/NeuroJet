NeuroJet
========

NeuroJet is a tool that allows computational neuroscience researchers to
model large networks quickly using the NeuroJet programming language. Many
simulations are currently done in MATLAB, which can take days for large
networks to complete running. NeuroJet is significantly faster than MATLAB,
especially for large simulations, and can be easily parallelized.

## Installation

To install NeuroJet, first clone the code into the appropriate folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbarrow/NeuroJet.git
```

This will give you the most up-to-date build. After that, installation is
as simple as

```
make NeuroJet
```
